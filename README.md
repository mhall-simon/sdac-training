# Welcome to SDAC Python Training!

Presented By: Matthew Hall

## Instructions for Training

Currently, you're looking at a GitHub repository! Don't worry if you don't understand everything just yet, it can be intimidating!

For the training, we're all going to use Google Colab! If you cannot access Google Colab because it is behind a firewall, don't fret. There's a few things you can do too.

### Installation Instructions #1 (Recommended Method)

1. Go to Google Colab in Your Browser (Chrome Recommended): colab.research.google.com

2. On launch screen, navigate to tab **GitHub**, then enter my username *mhall-simon* into the search bar.

If you don't see the launch screen, go to *file > open notebook*

3. Select the repository *mhall-simon/sdac-training* from the dropdown that appears, and leave the branch at *main*

4. To make sure everything is working before training, select the notebook at *notebooks/sample.ipynb* and open it.

5. Run the code cell by pushing the play button to make sure everything works! If you're on Colab, it should!!
