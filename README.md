# Welcome to SDAC Python Training!

Presented By: Matthew Hall

## Instructions for Training

Currently, you're looking at a GitHub repository! Don't worry if you don't understand everything just yet, it can be intimidating!

Before that, there's 2 learning methods that you might want to try out for the training:

---

### Learning Methods

1. Sit Back & Watch, Trying to Absorb Content Being Covered (Best if you just have a laptop)

2. Code Along! (Easier if you have multiple monitors)

All the materials (and recording) will eventually be available, so it's really up to you!

---

### Installation Instructions #1 (Recommended Method)

For the training, we're all going to use Google Colab! If you cannot access Google Colab because it is behind a firewall, don't fret. There's a few things you can do too.

1. Go to Google Colab in Your Browser (Chrome Recommended): colab.research.google.com

2. On launch screen, navigate to tab **GitHub**, then enter my username *mhall-simon* into the search bar.

If you don't see the launch screen, go to *file > open notebook*

3. Select the repository *mhall-simon/sdac-training* from the dropdown that appears, and leave the branch at *main*

4. To make sure everything is working before training, select the notebook at *notebooks/sample.ipynb* and open it.

5. Run the code cell by pushing the play button to make sure everything works! If you're on Colab, it should!!

### Installation Alternate: Download Notebooks from GitHub

If the above methods don't work, you'll have to download the materials and either:

1. Attempt to open in Google Colab by clicking *file > open notebook > upload* and upload the notebook.

2. Install Anaconda & Jupyter Notebooks onto your personal computer (last resort! Or is you are behind a firewall)

---

#### Downloading Files From GitHub

1. Scroll up to the top of this page

2. In the top right corner, click on the green download icon and download repository as a zip.

### Installation Alternate: Anaconda & Jupyter Notebook on Your Personal Computer

**Only do this if you're behind a firewall! I'm trying to use Google Colab so we are all working in the same environment.**

There's far too many variables to put one concise direction set together, so you'll have to do the following:

1. Install Anaconda [Here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

2. Check Out Their Quick Start Guide [Here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/)

3. Read How To Open Jupyter Notebook [Here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#run-python-in-a-jupyter-notebook)

4. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to where you saved the notebooks, and open it!
